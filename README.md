Files for a book reader webapplication

This application functions by taking a book divided into chapters and a table of contents with each being a separate text file and being stored in the 'DATA' folder

## How to use

Split a book into separate .txt files for each chapter and store in the 'DATA' Folder.
From there run the following commands

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec ruby book_viewer/book_viewer.rb
```

After running these commands, if you visit localhost:4567, you will have access to your book reader!
